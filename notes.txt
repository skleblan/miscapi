How to Test

wget -nv -O - http://<host>/api/v0/hello

wget defaults to printing out verbose meta-data
-nv means non-verbose (small amount of meta-data)
-q means quiet

-O means redirect "ALL" output to specified filename or STDOUT if "-" specified

--post-data 'key=value&key=value'

found issue w/ nginx using 3xx codes to redirect http to https
see https://rtfm.co.ua/en/http-redirects-post-and-get-requests-and-lost-data/

long story short, use https to start
then you won't have issues with "POSTS" changing to "GETS"
